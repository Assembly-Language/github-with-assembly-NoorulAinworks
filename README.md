remarks about sum-even:

here we are calculating total even numbers in the array
-we will check the lowest bit
-if it is zero the number is even
-if the number is 1 then it is odd

remarks about sum-odd:

here we will calculate the total odd numbers in the array
-we will check the lowest bit 
-if it is zero the number is even
-if the number is 1 then it is odd

remarks about sum-pos:
we will check the highest bit
-if it is 1 then the number is negative
-if the number is 0 then it is positive
-the TEST instruction will be used here


Overall remarks:
this is about the code for sum-even, sum-odd, sum-pos and we are using conditional loops and jumps to move to specific label after a spicific condition is met.
